# `useCldImageUrl`

---

This composable is using [@cloudinary-util/url-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mcloudinary-util/url-loeader) under the hood to generate the Cloudinary URL with certain optimizations.

## Usage

The composable allows you to pass optimization options and the src of the image and in return get a full cloudinary url with the optimized images. Then, you can use this url any way you like (for example in the custom image component).

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { url } = useCldImageUrl({
  options: {
    src: "/cld-sample-5.jpg",
    tint: "40:253f8c",
    underlay: "/cld-sample-4.jpg",
    overlays: [
      {
        position: {
          gravity: "north",
          y: 60,
        },
        text: {
          color: "rgb:52a4ff80",
          fontFamily: "Source Sans Pro",
          fontSize: 320,
          fontWeight: "black",
          text: "MUSIC",
          letterSpacing: -10,
          lineSpacing: -100,
          stroke: true,
          border: "20px_solid_rgb:2d0eff99",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
</script>
```

Apart from the image options, `useCldImageUrl` composable accepts two additional parameters; `config` and `analytics`. For full documentation on the usage of the Cloudinary URL Loader, check out the official documentation [here](ADD_LINK_HERE)
